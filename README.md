# Mathrageous Observations

_I don’t like the math. But the math likes me._

This is a collection of unorthodox, structure-first mathematical thought pieces. Most were written before coffee. Some dismantle sacred assumptions. All of them try to make something visible that shouldn’t be invisible.

## What’s in here

- A deterministic primality test that passes zero pseudoprimes  
- A constructive disproof of Navier-Stokes global regularity  
- A reframing of P vs NP based on structural collapse  
- Modular residue patterns in twin primes  
- Collapse geometry of the natural numbers  
- A post-measurement diagnostic model that replaces SEM, CDM, and coefficient alpha with deterministic scoring, predictive alignment, and profile-aware diagnostics  
- Whatever else needs to be said before someone else gets tenure for half the thought

## Who this is for

People who:
- Think the Q-matrix was a cry for help  
- Believe Cronbach’s alpha should be quietly retired  
- Want scoring systems that don't guess  
- Have a hard time explaining what they do without drawing vectors in the air

## Who I am

Kevin E. Wells, Ph.D.  
Structural thinker, diagnostic architect, and the other Dr. Wells.  
I build systems. I also name them.
