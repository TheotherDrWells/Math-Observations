# Math Observations

This is a collection of unorthodox, structure-first mathematical thought pieces. Most were written before coffee. Some attempt to dismantle sacred assumptions. All of them try to make something visible that shouldn’t be invisible.

## What’s in here

- Lspt3.pdf - A deterministic primality test that passes zero pseudoprimes 
- Collapse.pdf - Collapse geometry of the natural numbers
- collatz.pdf - my take on the Collatz conjecture
- Whatever else needs to be said before someone else gets tenure for half the thought

## Who I am

*Slacking. Always slacking. Until the math fights back.*


Update: Originally thought this identity (LSPT) held universally for primes, but later testing showed certain Carmichael numbers (e.g., 561) also satisfy it for small bases. The conjecture as stated is not sufficient for primality testing, but residue-based analysis still shows structural promise.
